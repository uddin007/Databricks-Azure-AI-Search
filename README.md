# Databricks-Azure-AI-Search
Azure AI Vector + Semantic Search is a powerful feature of Microsoft Azure's AI services that enhances search capabilities by combining vector-based and semantic search techniques. Here's a summary:

### **1. Vector Search**
   - **Purpose**: Designed to handle unstructured data like text, images, and audio by converting them into high-dimensional vectors using AI models.
   - **Functionality**: It allows searching based on the similarity of content rather than just keywords, enabling more relevant results even when exact terms are not used. This is especially useful for complex queries where the exact wording might not match the stored data.

### **2. Semantic Search**
   - **Purpose**: Enhances traditional keyword search by understanding the context and meaning behind search queries.
   - **Functionality**: It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to provide results that are contextually relevant, focusing on the intent of the query rather than just matching keywords. This improves the accuracy and relevance of search results, making it easier to find precise information.

### **3. Combined Capabilities**
   - **Integration**: The combination of vector search with semantic search allows for a more robust and intelligent search experience. Vector search handles complex, unstructured data while semantic search ensures that the results are contextually relevant.
   - **Use Cases**: This combination is particularly beneficial in applications such as enterprise search, customer support, and content discovery, where understanding user intent and content similarity is crucial.
